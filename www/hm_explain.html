        <p>
            The graph above is hoping to provide answers to many reserach questions,
            for example, <em>which district in Chicago has committed the most crimes?</em>
            or <em>what type of crime that have been most committed?</em>. Which we can
            notice from the <em>color scale</em> on the graph that crimes have been heavily
            commited in the <span class="key">west side district</span> and
            <span class="key">battery type of crime</span> has been popularly committed over the past 10 years.
            <br />
            <br />
            Users can also choose <span class="key">the range of the year</span> and their <span class="key">district of
                interest</span> to answer many interesting questions. Last but not least,
            users can choose to whether they want to see information in more detail
            by enabling <span class="key">the log option</span>.
